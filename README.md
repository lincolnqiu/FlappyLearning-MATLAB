# FlappyLearning-MATLAB
Inspired by [xviniette](https://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning). Flappy Bird now learns and flys in MATLAB. With Neuroevolution. [Demo(bilibili.com)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1xy4y1i73s/)

This is the final assignment of my freshman year's course ***Introduction to Computers***, whose requirement is ***Using Matlab and Matlab only***. The project features certain improvements, but it generally converges slower than [xviniette](https://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning)'s for some unknown reason. Nonetheless, it does the trick.

Runs well on R2020b.  

## Features
* Adds variable `regenerateFlag` together with `shitCount`. 
* Reduced complexity. The structure looks more intuitive. But the network's universality is also reduced, for that certain functions are tailored.
